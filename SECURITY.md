# Security Guidelines

## Fixed Security Issues

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Hard-coded API credentials** - Moved to environment variables
2. **Log injection vulnerability** - Added input sanitization
3. **Missing authorization** - Added form validation and rate limiting
4. **Package vulnerabilities** - Updated to secure versions

### Environment Variables Setup:
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual EmailJS credentials
3. Never commit `.env.local` to version control

### Security Best Practices:
- All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- Form validation prevents malicious submissions  
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Images have fallback handling for failed loads
- Package dependencies are kept up to date

### Vulnerability Scanning:
Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities.
Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix issues when possible.
